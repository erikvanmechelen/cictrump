# Precinct Caucus

Precinct caucuses are the foundation and first in a series of elections of delegates who then determine which candidates end up on the ballot for major political parties in Minnesota.

The time and manner of holding a caucus is outlined in [Minnesota Statute 202A.14](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.14). The caucus call, a notice with information about the meeting, must also be sent out in advance.

The primary purpose of the caucus is to elect precinct delegates, sometimes referred to as Basic Political Organizing Unit (BPOU) delegates. These delegates will then elect both state convention delegates (in even years) and state central committee delegates (in odd years).

Precinct delegates are elected permanently [according to Minnesota Statute 202A.18(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.18). That is, once elected, an individual remains a precinct delegate until the next precinct caucus two years later. That means February 27, 2024 is the first chance to replace the delegates that are currently duly elected, because their two-year term will ened.

>Subd. 2.Nominations; time of election of officers and delegates.

>Nominations for the election of permanent officers and delegates shall remain open for at least the first quarter hour of the caucus. Election of delegates and alternates must begin within one hour of convening a caucus. Election of delegates and alternates may begin one-half hour after the convening of the caucus.


But what happens if that process is corrupted such that a party is out of compliance with its own constitution and rules by, for just one example, disenfranchising duly elected delegates? (More on this later.)

Because it's a good habit to read your Bible and Minnesota Statutes in context, here is the precinct caucus procedure as defined in Minnesota Statute, without redactions.

Let's take these one at a time. 

Whomever is the convener will be the temporary chair. This can be changed at the beginning of the precinct caucus if people want a different chair. Simply make a motion, have it seconded, and then vote in favor. 

Next, nominations for officers and delegates. For the moment we will pass over the officer portion.

In the case of delegates, an individual may self-nominate. If you want to be a delegate, and that is the most important aspect of showing up to a precinct caucus, simply announce your intent to become a delegate. 

If there are more people that wish to be delegates than there are delegate slots available, each man and woman may be given the chance to give a short speech as to why they would like to take on this responsibility. I suggest speaking from the heart, perhaps a brief anecdote about how you woke up to the rampant corruption in society, and why now is the time to be a voice for accountability in the elections process and in selecting candidates the party will later endorse.

When vote-counting occurs, make sure that someone you trust (that might have to be yourself) is observing the vote-counting. As an observer, you can ask questions and ask that a particular ballot or set of ballots be checked again for accuracy. It is permissible (unless explicitly against the rules in your BPOU) to take a video or photos of the ballot counting and vote tallying.

At my BPOU convention in Spring 2022, to select state convention delegates, I was observing the vote tallying and found that my vote was miscounted (by one vote). If I wasn't there watching, it might not have been caught. In Spring 2023, I witnessed [overt cheating](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/a-live-audit-of-a-hand-count-changes) in Senate District 50, which had it not been caught would have made at least two people incorrectly elected as officers. Regrettably, I am confident that at least one state central delegate got elected through cheating which I was unable to prevent. And according to the outgoing officers, the ballots for that race were shredded that very night. That meant that there was one more body (who should never have been there) favorable to the current Chair of the Republican Party, David Hann, present and seated as a delegate on December 9, 2023, when there was a vote on his removal. 

At your precinct caucus, when the results of the delegate elections are announced, be sure to take photographic evidence (by snapping a picture on your phone) of the results. The resulting delegate lists *must* match the delegate lists which are presented to the the chair of the county or legislative district executive committee and to the chair of the state central committee. The video and photo evidence you capture may well be useful in court if things go awry. Either way, evidence is much stronger than anecdotes in persuading those who were not in attendance to become aware of the cheating, if it were to occur.

At the recent state central meeting, Mandy Heffron, who gave a presentation on precinct caucus prepartion, when confronted about the 2022 precinct caucuses, said she did not want to speak about the past. I wouldn't either if I'd cheated so blatantly, gotten caught, and had yet to resolve the issue. To be fair to Mandy, it's likely she isn't being allowed to solve the problem, because it would not help the cause of the Party elites. 

In 2022, members of the Republican Party of Minnesota, including but not limited to Mandy Heffron, committed delegate list fraud, by removing and inserting names, in multiple BPOUs, which in some cases was not only unaddressed but not remedied, to this day. [SaveMinnesota.org](https://saveminnesota.org) and [https://rebuildthemngop.com](RebuildtheMNGOP.com) are good starting points for further study on same. [RinoBusters.org](https://rinobusters.org) is another site focusing on the Party's interference with BPOU-level business.

Changing the delegate lists constitutes a violation of [Minnesota Statute 202A.18](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.18?ref=projectminnesota.com). Unfortunately, the Party has perpetuated the fraud by refusing to hold itself accountable, even though many members of the Party are aware and have sought relief and reinstatement of the proper and duly elected delegates. 

Remember, delegates are permanent and cannot be removed. 

## The Consequences of Delegate Fraud

What are the consequences of delegate fraud at the precinct caucus? 

Simple. It changes a lot.

Thereafter, every election that involves that particular group of delegates where election interference occurred, is called into question, by definition. 

Since delegate list manipulation did in fact occur in multiple counties, and audits were not conducted in many BPOUs (there could have been even more undiscovered fraud), all subsequent elections, which includes the election of state convention delegates, the endorsement of candidates, and the election of state central delegates, are suspect, from 2022 through to 2023. Getting election results incorrect (or changing them), compounds in the following tiers of elections. 

I've estimated that anywhere from 5-20% of delegates that ended up at state convention or on state central should not be delegates, but it is difficult to know for sure. The black eye that is [Otter Tail](https://saveminnesota.org/otter-tail/), though, demonstrates that when the foundation, the precinct caucus, is corrupted, then a senator can be seated in St. Paul who should have had no business near the Capitol.

But 2024 is a chance to refresh the delegate slate completely once again. 

## Numbers

This time, precinct caucus attendees would do well to understand the caucus proceedings, the election process, the vote tally verification process, Robert's Rules of Order. Any deviations from proper process should be called out immediately.

Of course, there are things one can do in advance of caucus as an insurance policy against opposition cheating.

As candidates, Nathan Wesenberg and Mark Bishofsky both showed how to attract large numbers of supporters to caucus, in Morrison County and Washington County respectively. This helped both candidates have delegates in their corner ahead of the endorsing conventions to come.

Wesenberg's senate district convention was halted without completing vote counting, in my view to prevent him receiving the endorsement. There is also photo evidence from that convention of ballots changing hands in violation of the rules. Party insiders went on to monetarily support another candidate in the primary, but Wesenberg prevailed. 

Mark Bishofsky received the endorsement, but then Party insiders put forward their own candidate to run against him in the primary election. 

The simplest way to attract numbers to the precinct caucus is by talking to your neighbors. Instead of door-knocking to get votes for the general election months and months away, conversations could be focused on inviting one's neighbor to caucus, which is right around the corner, on February 27, 2024. 

The conversation could be simple: We are taking back control of the political process, and then the local and state government, by showing up to become delegates. Do you want to be a part of this historic process? If you don't, someone else will decide the fate of the place you call home.
