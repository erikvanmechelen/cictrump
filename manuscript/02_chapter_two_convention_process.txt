# Convention Process

What happens if you become a delegate? 

Then you gain the responsibility to elect delegates to state convention as well as vote upon candidates during endorsing conventions, sometimes referred to as senate district conventions or congressional district conventions. 

Pay close attention to the process for nominating yourself to be a state convention delegate. I nearly missed my opportunity. I was in the BPOU convention at Minnehaha Academy about a month after the precinct caucus at the same venue. I was a BPOU delegate, but didn't understand that there was another step to become a state convention delegate. 

I actually got up and crossed the room to share my intent with the BPOU Chair, who added my name to a list, which already had about 12 other names printed on it. About five more people figured out that this was an option, and self-nominated at that time as well. A few of us became state convention delegates. In other words, I was a few moments from *missing out* on being at state convention. 

If you are new, ask your neighbor or email your BPOU Chair as frequently as you need to ensure you are following the prescribed process. A simple way to be excluded is by missing basic details like this. 

## Answering Convention Calls

Convention calls are notifications, usually sent by email, which inform delegates of the time, location, and agenda for an upcoming convention. Once again, if you do not receive a convention call that you believe you should have received, reach out to your BPOU Chair, or ask another delegate to forward you the information. 

Now, of the over 100 BPOU delegates elected at my precinct caucus on February 2, 2022, only 33 showed up to the BPOU convention, where a new BPOU Chair was elected, a house of representatives candidate was endorsed, and all the state convention delegates, 11 of them, myself included, were voted on from a pool of about 19. The rest of those who nominated themselves from that pool became alternates. 

To avoid low turnout in the convention following the precinct caucus, if you are good at record keeping, consider getting the names and contact info of as many of the elected delegates as possible. This way you can keep a list separate from the BPOU Chair and ensure that those who you want to be at the upcoming BPOU convention actually show up. Historically, a small group of Party insiders has been able to maintain a grip on power with a relatively small but committed, loyal group, simply by showing up.
