# Precinct Caucus

Precinct caucuses are the foundation and first in a series of elections of delegates who then determine which candidates end up on the ballot for major political parties in Minnesota.

The time and manner of holding a caucus is outlined in [Minnesota Statute 202A.14](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.14). The caucus call, a notice with information about the meeting, must also be sent out in advance.

The primary purpose of the caucus is to elect precinct delegates, sometimes referred to as Basic Political Organizing Unit (BPOU) delegates.

Precinct delegates are elected permanently [according to Minnesota Statute 202A.18(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.18). That is, once elected, an individual remains a precinct delegate until the next precinct caucus two years later.

>Nominations for the election of permanent officers and delegates shall remain open for at least the first quarter hour of the caucus. Election of delegates and alternates must begin within one hour of convening a caucus. Election of delegates and alternates may begin one-half hour after the convening of the caucus.


But what happens if that process is corrupted such that a party is out of compliance with its own constitution and rules by, for just one example, disenfranchising duly elected delegates? (More on this later.)

Critically


Here is the precinct caucus procedure as defined in Minnesota Statute.

202A.18 CAUCUS, PROCEDURE.
Subdivision 1. Temporary chair. The convener shall be the temporary chair of the caucus.

Subd. 2. Nominations; time of election of officers and delegates. Nominations for the election of permanent officers and delegates shall remain open for at least the first quarter hour of the caucus. Election of delegates and alternates must begin within one hour of convening a caucus. Election of delegates and alternates may begin one-half hour after the convening of the caucus.

Subd. 2a. Preference ballot for governor. In a year when the office of governor appears on the state general election ballot, prior to the opening of nominations for the election of permanent offices and delegates, a ballot must be distributed to permit caucus participants to indicate their preference for the office of the governor. The results of preference voting must be reported to the secretary of state immediately upon conclusion of the voting, in the manner provided by the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall provide the appropriate forms to the party for reporting the results.

Subd. 3. Secret ballot. All voting shall be by secret ballot.

Subd. 4. Announcement and certification of election results. Upon completion of the counting of votes the chair shall announce the names of persons who are elected, and shall certify the names to the chair of the county or legislative district executive committee and to the chair of the state central committee.

Subd. 5. Rules of order. All questions concerning the manner in which a caucus is conducted or called that are not covered by statute shall be determined by Robert's Rules of Order (revised) unless otherwise specified by party rules.

Let's take these one at a time. 

Whomever is the convener will be the temporary chair. This can be changed. 

Next, nominations for officers and delegates. 

In the case of delegates, an individual may self-nominate. If you want to be a delegate, and that is the most important aspect of showing up to a precinct caucus, simply announce your intent to become a delegate. 

If there are more people that wish to be delegates than there are delegate slots available, each man and woman may be given the chance to give a short speech as to why they would like to take on this responsibility. I suggest speaking from the heart, perhaps a brief anecdote about how you woke up to the rampant corruption in society, and why now is the time to be a voice for accountability in the elections process and in selecting candidates the party will later endorse.

When vote-counting occurs, make sure that someone you trust (that might have to be yourself) is observing the vote-counting. As an observer, you can ask questions and ask that a particular ballot or set of ballots be checked again for accuracy. It is permissible (unless explicitly against the rules in your BPOU) to take a video or photos of the ballot counting and vote tallying.

When the results of the delegate elections are announced, be sure to take photographic evidence (by snapping a picture on your phone) of the results. The resulting delegate lists *must* match the delegate lists which are presented to the the chair of the county or legislative district executive committee and to the chair of the state central committee.

In 2022, members of the Republican Party of Minnesota committed delegate list fraud, by removing and inserting names, in multiple BPOUs, which in some cases was not only unaddressed but not remedied. This constitutes a violation of Minnesota Statute. Unfortunately, the Party has perpetuated the fraud by refusing to hold itself accountable, even though many members of the Party are aware and have sought relief and reinstatement of the proper and duly elected delegates. Remember, delegates are permanent and cannot be removed. 

## The Consequences of Delegate Fraud

What are the consequences of delegate fraud at the precinct caucus? 

Simple. 

Thereafter, every election that involves that particular group of delegates where election interference occurred, is called into question, by definition. 

Since delegate list manipulation did in fact occur in multiple counties, and audits were not conducted in many BPOUs, all subsequent elections, which includes the election of state convention delegates, the endorsement of candidates, and the election of state central delegates, are all suspect, from 2022 through to 2023.

But 2024 is a chance to refresh the delegate slate completely once again. 

## Numbers

This time, precinct caucus attendees would do well to understand the caucus proceedings, the election process, the vote tally verification process, Robert's Rules of Order. Any deviations from proper process should be called out immediately.

Of course, there are things one can do in advance of caucus as an insurance policy against opposition cheating.

As candidates, Nathan Wesenberg and Mark Bishofsky both showed how to attract large numbers of supporters to caucus, in Morrison County and Washington County respectively. This helped both candidates have delegates in their corner ahead of the endorsing conventions to come.

Wesenberg's senate district convention was halted without completing vote counting, in my view to prevent him receiving the endorsement. There is also photo evidence from that convention of ballots changing hands in violation of the rules. Party insiders went on to monetarily support another candidate in the primary, but Wesenberg prevailed. 

Mark Bishofsky received the endorsement, but then Party insiders put forward their own candidate to run against him in the primary election. 

The simplest way to attract numbers to the precinct caucus is by talking to your neighbors. Instead of door-knocking to get votes for the general election, conversations could be focused on inviting one's neighbor to caucus. 

The conversation could be simple. We are taking back control of the political process, and then the local and state government, by showing up to become delegates. Do you want to be a part of this historic process? If you don't, someone else will decide the fate of the place you call home.
