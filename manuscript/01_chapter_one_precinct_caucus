# Precinct Caucus

Precinct caucuses are the foundation and first in a series of elections from the perspective of which candidates end up on the ballot for major political parties in Minnesota. 

Precinct delegates are elected permanently [according to Minnesota Statute 202A.18(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/202A.18?ref=projectminnesota.com). 

>Subd. 2.Nominations; time of election of officers and delegates.
>
>Nominations for the election of permanent officers and delegates shall remain open for at least the first quarter hour of the caucus. Election of delegates and alternates must begin within one hour of convening a caucus. Election of delegates and alternates may begin one-half hour after the convening of the caucus.


But what happens if that process is corrupted such that a party is out of compliance with its own constitution and rules by, for just one example, disenfranchising duly elected delegates? (More on this later.)
